Case A: Bit Counter

1. Suppose you have a large file (eg. jpg)

2. A file is stored on a disk as a bunch of zeros and ones

3. We want to know how many zeros and ones there are in the file

4. We would like to do a call (in IRB) (or something like it):

count_bits "/path/to/some/file.jpg"

Example output (to stdout is ok):

found 456 bits set to 1
found 128 bits set to 0
